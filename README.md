# Todo-Management-with-Spring-Security
A TODO management developed with additional Spring security which is an extension of my previously built application called User management . 

## Motivation
In today's world as there are many works to be completed keeping track of each work's progress is a hectic and tedius job. No matter how much rememberance any individual has there is a possibility that we might forget to keep track of any work. Therefore, this project is built to address this issue and help people to have a good track of works by just performing some operations in REST APIS. 
As there will be a different todos lists for different people. There is therefore a necessity to built such that one user must not involve other user's todo list. Thus, due to this fact **Spring Security** has been included to secure the acess of todos for user and admin based on their roles.

## Requirements :-
  - Postman API
  - IntelliJ Idea
  - MySQL

  - Basic Form based auntentication provided by SpringBoot.
